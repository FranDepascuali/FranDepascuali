Howdy, friend! I'm Depa :)

I'm a senior software engineer with +9 years in iOS development and +5 years with React Native.
I'm currently working as staff backend engineer at https://github.com/jpg-store.

My approach is to build from the ground up and explain the reasons behind abstractions (only if they are necessary). I reflecton how to think, not just as a recipe to use (because there's no single solution to a problem!).

«For men of experience know that the thing is so, but do not know why, while the others know the ‘why’ and the cause. Hence we think also that the masterworkers in each craft are more honourable and know in a truer sense and are wiser than the manual workers, because they know the causes of the things that are done» (Aristotle, Metaphysics A1)

I've graduated as a software engineer in Argentina and performed further studies in Austria, achieving a Master's Degree in Software Engineering. I'm back at university studying philosophy. I've also been an assistant professor in functional programming at ITBA.

I've given technical talks in Swift Meetups, lead multiple teams and mentor people throughout Codementor and MentorCruise. In addition to mobile programming, I'm also experienced in Python, React, backend && multiple programming languages.

I've contributed to @JPGStore, @Apple, @Theorem, @Brubank, @Wolox, @AIT, @getmimo and @MURAL.

I'm collecting my essays in this repo: https://github.com/FranDepascuali/essays

Nice to meet you,
Depa
